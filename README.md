## 🛠 About Me
I'm a backend developer & founder of [Hostile](https://github.com/hostile), a cyber security firm specializing in OSINT investigations and data aggregation across the web. I mainly develop in Python, however am slowly learning other languages! I started learning how to program in late 2021, and am excited to progress in my journey as a software developer.

In 2023, I started pursuing multiple qualifications in Computer Science, along with collaborating on larger projects.


## 💬 Skills & Interests
My interests are pivoted around backend web and software development, and I aspire to explore this more in the future. I am a large believer in the wider adoption of collectible usernames.
