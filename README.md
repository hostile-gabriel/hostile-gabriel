I'm a backend developer & founder of [Hostile](https://github.com/hostile), a cyber security firm specializing in OSINT investigations and data aggregation across the web. I mainly develop in Python, however am slowly learning other languages! I started learning how to program in late 2021, and am excited to progress in my journey as a software developer.

In 2024, after a long programming hiatus, I've initiated development on multipe passion projects, attempting to hone my frontend development skills; in order to independently develop & maintain multiple full-stack web apps. My current focus is on my AI car aggregator, [autoflip.ai.](https://github.com/autoflip-ai)
